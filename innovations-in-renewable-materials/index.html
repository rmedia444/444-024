                    In 2010, the development of renewable materials was gaining attention as a sustainable alternative to traditional resources. Innovations in bioplastics, recycled materials, and biodegradable composites aimed to reduce environmental impact and promote circular economies. These materials were being used in various industries, from packaging to construction, offering eco-friendly solutions.
