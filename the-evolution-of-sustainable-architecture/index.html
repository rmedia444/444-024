                    Sustainable architecture was evolving in 2010, with a focus on designing buildings that minimized environmental impact and enhanced occupant well-being. Innovations in green building materials, energy-efficient systems, and passive design strategies were driving this transformation. Architects and builders were increasingly incorporating features such as solar panels, green roofs, and natural ventilation into their projects.

                    The push towards sustainable architecture aimed to reduce the carbon footprint of buildings, promote resource efficiency, and create healthier living and working environments. This period marked a significant shift towards more eco-friendly and resilient architectural practices.
