                Educating students about mental health and wellness fosters resilience, empathy, and support for those struggling with mental health issues. By integrating mental health education into school curricula and providing resources for students, teachers, and parents, we can create safe and supportive learning environments where mental health is prioritized.
                <br>
                By breaking down stigmas and promoting open dialogue about mental health, we can empower young people to seek help when needed and build a more compassionate and understanding society.
