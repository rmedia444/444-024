                    3D printing technology was expanding rapidly in 2010, offering new capabilities in manufacturing, prototyping, and customization. Also known as additive manufacturing, 3D printing allowed objects to be created layer by layer from digital designs, using materials ranging from plastics to metals and even biological substances.

                    The growth of 3D printing promised to revolutionize industries such as aerospace, healthcare, and consumer goods by enabling rapid prototyping, on-demand manufacturing, and complex geometries that were difficult to achieve with traditional methods. This period marked a transformative shift towards more agile and efficient production processes.
